I have created this mini script to get json file from s3, edit the file and upload it back to the same URI.

The lambda function can list all the URIs and we can use those URIs in the edit_s3 script and we can run the whole show in a container

I am editing some random keys from a random file wehre you can change the key according to your file

Thank you!!
